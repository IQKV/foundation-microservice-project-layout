/**
 * Guard component for plan feature entitlement checks.
 *
 * <p>Acts as the single authoritative gate for "does this plan include feature X?" decisions
 * within this service. All callers pass the {@code planCode} extracted from the caller's
 * JWT ({@code plan_code} claim); this guard resolves the feature set from the local
 * {@link PlanCatalogCache} — no remote call is made at check time.
 *
 * <p>A feature is considered <em>enabled</em> when its entry exists in the plan's features
 * map <strong>and</strong> its {@code value} is {@code "true"} (case-insensitive).
 * Missing entries and {@code "false"} values are both treated as disabled.
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   // In a controller, with plan_code sourced from the caller's JWT:
 *   planFeatureGuard.require(planCode, PlanFeatureGuard.ADVANCED_ANALYTICS);
 *   // Proceeds if enabled; throws PlanFeatureNotAvailableException otherwise.
 * }</pre>
