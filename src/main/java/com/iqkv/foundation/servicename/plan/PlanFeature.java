/**
 * Local copy of a single named feature entry as returned by the billing service

 * are ignored by the Jackson deserializer.

 * @param title       human-readable label
 * @param value       feature value as a string ({@code "true"}/{@code "false"} or a number)
 * @param description optional description shown on pricing pages
